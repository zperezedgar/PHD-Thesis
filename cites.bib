abstract = {We establish a model to describe any alkali-metal atom interacting with a position- and time-dependent magnetic field. It includes the hyperfine structure of the atom and quantizes its center-of-mass motion. The model is used to characterize a proposed phase-space selector. It consists of a method based on hyperfine magnetic dipole transitions to prepare samples of atoms with well-defined position and velocity. The evolution of the atom is determined analytically and relevant physical quantities such as the probability of transition and the expected values of position and momentum are analyzed. It is concluded that the phase-space selector can lead to samples of atoms whose width in velocity tends to those obtained using velocity-dependent Raman transitions. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Nine carbonaceous chondrites have been analyzed for potassiu, rubidium, and strontium elemental concentrations and Sr isotropic composition. Two additional carbonaceous chondrites were analyzed for K and Rb concentrations only. Possibly because of Rb and Sr contamination, the type 1 carbonaceous chondrites Orgueil and Ivuna, and the type 2 chondrites Cold Bokkeveld and Erakot, do not fall on the bronzite isochron, which has an age of 4. 69.},

Energy accuracy ranges between 8 and 10 significant figures, reducing by between 21 and 2770 times the energy errors of the previous such compilation (E. Clementi and C. Roetti, Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables 14, 177, 1974). For each atom, the total energy, kinetic energy, potential energy, virial ratio, electron density at the nucleus, and the Kato cusp are given together with radial expectation values 〈rn〉 with n from -3 to 2 for each orbital, orbital energies, and orbital expansion coefficients. {\textcopyright} 1993 Academic Press.
