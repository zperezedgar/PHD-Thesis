abstract = {We establish a model to describe any alkali-metal atom interacting with a position- and time-dependent magnetic field. It includes the hyperfine structure of the atom and quantizes its center-of-mass motion. The model is used to characterize a proposed phase-space selector. It consists of a method based on hyperfine magnetic dipole transitions to prepare samples of atoms with well-defined position and velocity. The evolution of the atom is determined analytically and relevant physical quantities such as the probability of transition and the expected values of position and momentum are analyzed. It is concluded that the phase-space selector can lead to samples of atoms whose width in velocity tends to those obtained using velocity-dependent Raman transitions. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In this reference we present many of the physical and optical properties of 87Rb that are relevant to various quantum optics experiments. In particular, we give parameters that are useful in treating the mechanical effects of light on 87Rb atoms. The measured numbers are given with their original references, and the calculated numbers are presented with an overview of their calculation along with references to more comprehensive discussions of their underlying theory. At present, this document is not a critical review of experimental data, nor is it even guaranteed to be correct; for any numbers critical to your research, you should consult the original references. We also present a detailed discussion of the calculation of fluorescence scattering rates, because this topic is often not treated clearly in the literature. More details and derivations regarding the theoretical formalism here may be found in Ref. 1.

	abstract = {We have built an atom interferometer that can measure g, the local acceleration due to gravity, with a resolution of Δg/g = 2 × 10−8 after a single 1.3 s measurement cycle, 3 × 10−9 after 1 min and 1 × 10−10 after two days of integration time. The difference between our value for g and one obtained by a falling corner-cube optical interferometer is (7 ± 7) × 10−9 g. The atom interferometer uses velocity-selective stimulated Raman transitions and laser-cooled caesium atoms in an atomic fountain. We extend previous methods of analysing the interferometer to include the effects of a gravitational gradient. We also present detailed experimental and theoretical studies of potential systematic errors and noise sources.}

abstract={Gravimetry is a well-established technique for the determination of sub-surface mass distribution needed in several fields of geoscience, and various types of gravimeters have been developed over the last 50 years. Among them, quantum gravimeters based on atom interferometry have shown top-level performance in terms of sensitivity, long-term stability and accuracy. Nevertheless, they have remained confined to laboratories due to their complex operation and high sensitivity to the external environment. Here we report on a novel, transportable, quantum gravimeter that can be operated under real world conditions by non-specialists, and measure the absolute gravitational acceleration continuously with a long-term stability below 10 nm.s−2 (1 $\mu$Gal). It features several technological innovations that allow for high-precision gravity measurements, while keeping the instrument light and small enough for field measurements. The instrument was characterized in detail and its stability was evaluated during a month-long measurement campaign.},
