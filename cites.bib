abstract = {We establish a model to describe any alkali-metal atom interacting with a position- and time-dependent magnetic field. It includes the hyperfine structure of the atom and quantizes its center-of-mass motion. The model is used to characterize a proposed phase-space selector. It consists of a method based on hyperfine magnetic dipole transitions to prepare samples of atoms with well-defined position and velocity. The evolution of the atom is determined analytically and relevant physical quantities such as the probability of transition and the expected values of position and momentum are analyzed. It is concluded that the phase-space selector can lead to samples of atoms whose width in velocity tends to those obtained using velocity-dependent Raman transitions. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Gravimetry is a well-established technique for the determination of sub-surface mass distribution needed in several fields of geoscience, and various types of gravimeters have been developed over the last 50 years. Among them, quantum gravimeters based on atom interferometry have shown top-level performance in terms of sensitivity, long-term stability and accuracy. Nevertheless, they have remained confined to laboratories due to their complex operation and high sensitivity to the external environment. Here we report on a novel, transportable, quantum gravimeter that can be operated under real world conditions by non-specialists, and measure the absolute gravitational acceleration continuously with a long-term stability below 10 nm.s−2 (1 $\mu$Gal). It features several technological innovations that allow for high-precision gravity measurements, while keeping the instrument light and small enough for field measurements. The instrument was characterized in detail and its stability was evaluated during a month-long measurement campaign.},

Here we present an atom interferometer operating with single trapped atoms, where single particle wave packets are controlled through spin-dependent potentials. The interferometer is constructed from a sequence of discrete operations based on a set of elementary building blocks, which permit composing arbitrary interferometer geometries in a digital manner. We use this modularity to devise a space-time analogue of the well-known spin echo technique, yielding insight into decoherence mechanisms. We also demonstrate mesoscopic delocalization of single atoms with a separation-to-localization ratio exceeding 500; this result suggests their utilization beyond quantum logic applications as nano-resolution quantum probes in precision measurements, being able to measure potential gradients with precision 5\&nbsp;×\&nbsp;10-4 in units of gravitational acceleration g.}}

Since in conventional atom interferometers the internal atomic states are all exposed to the same acceleration a, this {\$}{\$}T^3{\$}{\$}-phase cancels out and the interferometer phase scales as {\$}{\$}T^2{\$}{\$}. In contrast, by applying an external magnetic field we prepare two different accelerations {\$}{\$}a{\_}1{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}a{\_}2{\$}{\$}for two internal states of the atom, which translate themselves into two different cubic phases and the resulting interferometer phase scales as {\$}{\$}T^3{\$}{\$}.

abstract="The force on atoms confined in the magnetic traps described in Chapter 10 arises from the permanent magnetic dipole moments of the atoms in the inhomogeneous field of the trap. By contrast, the inversion symmetry of atomic wave functions prevents them from having permanent electric dipole moments, so optical trapping of neutral atoms by electrical interaction must proceed by inducing a dipole moment. This can be accomplished either by electrostatic fields or by nearly resonant optical frequency fields. Inducing appropriate dipole moments with dc fields can be accomplished in atoms that have a sufficiently close-lying energy states of opposite parity (this excludes most atomic ground states but favors Rydberg states). By contrast, there are several types of optical traps that employ various configurations of laser beams [40, 41]. These produce not only the mixing of atomic states of opposite parity needed to provide dipole moments for interaction with the field, but also the strong field gradients appropriately arranged for such trapping.",

abstract = {A new computational method for determining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger equation is described. Conventional methods for solving this problem rely on diagonalization of a Hamiltonian matrix or iterative numerical solutions of a time independent wave equation. The new method, in contrast, is based on the spectral properties of solutions to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The method requires the computation of a correlation function 〈ψ(r, 0)| ψ(r, t)〉 from a numerical solution ψ(r, t). Fourier analysis of this correlation function reveals a set of resonant peaks that correspond to the stationary states of the system. Analysis of the location of these peaks reveals the eigenvalues with high accuracy. Additional Fourier transforms of ψ(r, t) with respect to time generate the eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated for a one-dimensional asymmetric double well potential and for the two-dimensional Hénon-Heiles potential.}

The method is about an order of magnitude faster than the existing split operator method. It can also be used to compute time-dependent states in monolayer graphene and other systems with a Hamiltonian that depends linearly on momentum. The new method is based on an operator splitting that reduces the cubic order local error that appears in any split operator approximation to the evolution operator. The reduced error allows a larger time step to be used and hence reduces computational cost. The computational cost and accuracy of the existing and new split operator methods are analysed for the test problem of computing the motion of a Landau wave packet in bilayer graphene in crossed electric and magnetic fields. A comparison with the Chebyshev polynomial method is also given.}

abstract="Operator splitting is a numerical method of computing the solution to a differential equation. The splitting method separates the original equation into two parts over a time step, separately computes the solution to each part, and then combines the two separate solutions to form a solution to the original equation. A canonical example is splitting of diffusion terms and convection terms in a convection-diffusion partial differential equation. Related applications of splitting for reaction-diffusion partial differential equations in chemistry and in biology are emphasized here. The splitting idea generalizes in a natural way to equations with more than two operators. In all cases, the computational advantage is that it is faster to compute the solution of the split terms separately, than to compute the solution directly when they are treated together. However, this comes at the cost of an error introduced by the splitting, so strategies have been devised to control this error. This chapter introduces splitting methods and surveys recent developments in the area. An interesting perspective on absorbing boundary conditions in wave equations comes via Toeplitz-plus-Hankel splitting. One recent development, balanced splitting, deserves and receives special mention: it is a new splitting method that correctly captures steady state behavior.",
